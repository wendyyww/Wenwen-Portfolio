        <h2>Designing a website from Scratch</h2>
        <p>
            A website which provides personal surveys for personnels or families who are looking for adopting 
            stray animals from shelters. Individuals would fill out a survey which tests their personality,
            life style, responsibilities, etc. and match puppies or kittens from shelter databases to them 
            automatically.
