            <h2>Redesigning Participant Tracking System for NPower</h2>
            <div class="consulting">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    NPower is a nonprofit tech-education organization whose mission is to boost diversity in the tech industry by supporting underrepresented people from underserved communities to launch digital careers. Their target audience is mainly young adults living in poverty, but also includes veterans and their spouses. They offer free, intensive technical training for their students which helps them establish technical-related careers.
                </p>
                <h3>The Project</h3>
                NPower Michigan currently uses several different tools to track and store their participants' information, including Excel and Salesforce. And our client is facing several problem with their current tracking system.
    With the goal of expanding the size of their trainee cohorts, NPower needs a better participant tracking system (PTS). They hope to find an active data management system which can store all the participant information in one place, with the ability to capture all data points from the participantsâ€™ application phases to alumni hoods.
                
                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                As a consulting team, we first decided each team member's roles. I act as the primary client contact and secondary graphic designer for NPower. 
                Our main checkpoints include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Background Research</li>
                    <li>Interviews and observations with clients.</li>
                    <li>Post-interview interpretation</li>
                    <li>Affinity wall.</li>
                    <li>Presentation and final report</li>
                </ul>
                Doing background research on an organization often provides insights that can inform
inform and supplement the ground-level view of our client's specific problem gained
through interviews and observations. To better understand our client, I carried out a ~4000 word
background research report in which I synthesized background research about NPower's competitors.

                Conducting Interviews is the secret to knowing the problem our client is facing and detecting their pain point. In this project, we conducted 6 interviews in total, and I took the initiative in two of them.
