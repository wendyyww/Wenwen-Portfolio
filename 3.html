        <h2>Illustrating a design process and showing prototypes, etc.</h2>
        <p>
            This would be my third project's illustration page. I do not have a demo for it right 
            now, and the iamges uploaded would be changed later. Now I am putting in my art assignment 
            about my hometown. Examples in the gallery page would be related to city recommendation.
