            We are concerned about the products sold through social media platform these days, 
            especially for health products.
            It is hard to regulate product safety issues through these purchases because everyone
            nowadays can own a business on social media. It is even harder for people to check these
            products' credibilities. Also, influencers who promote health products may lie about 
            effects. We aim to find a way to promote health product sales and provide customers with
            credible suggestions.
