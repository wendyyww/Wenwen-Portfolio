            <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
            <p>
                We are concerned about the products sold through social media platform these days, 
                especially for health products.
                It is hard to regulate product safety issues through these purchases because everyone
                nowadays can own a business on social media. It is even harder for people to check these
                products' credibilities. Also, influencers who promote health products may lie about 
                effects. We aim to find a way to promote health product sales and provide customers with
                credible suggestions.

            <span> Defining a practical problem statement and identifying user group through interview analysis was the crucial first steps that we undertook.
                We tried to interview a diverse group of potential users consist of interviewees from multi-aged and multi-gender groups.
