        <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
        <p>
          We are concerned about the products sold through social media platform
          these days, especially for health products. It is hard to regulate
          product safety issues through these purchases because everyone
          nowadays can own a business on social media. It is even harder for
          people to check these products' credibilities. Also, influencers who
          promote health products may lie about effects. We aim to find a way to
          promote health product sales and provide customers with credible
          suggestions.

          Defining a practical problem statement and identifying user group
          through interview analysis was the crucial first steps that we
          undertook. We tried to interview a diverse group of potential users
          consist of interviewees from multi-aged and multi-gender groups.

          After user research, we designed personas for our target user group to
          better locate main functions we need to include in our App. We had 6
          interviews with people from a variety of age and gender group, and
          people from different job roles. We designed the above personas based
          on these detailed interviews. To cover a wide range of users,
          therefore we created persona 1, who is a working mom and wants to save
          time on researching products, and persona 2, an old, stubborn male who
          wants to gather all necessary information for products at ease to cope
          with his picky wife.

          This story, created by me, delineates the story of the old man using
          our app. He is stubborn and lazy, and he makes purchase decision at
          once. Because of this, he had to fight with his wife, who cares about
          her husband's health a lot and who is extra alert of products sold
          online, very often. However, with the help of our app, he does not
          have to do product research about ingredients nor he needs to self
          look-up for product reviews. Ratings from both the consumer and the
          professional side is provided by us. Finally, he did not waste any
          time and did not suffer from waiting for approval. He is happy to show
          his wife all the information together at once, and he got to purchase
          his desired product.
